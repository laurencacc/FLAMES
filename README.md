**Senior Design | Group 6 | FLAMES Project**  
University of Central Florida  
Spring 2025 - Summer 2025

## Overview

The FLAMES (Fire Detection and Monitoring for Emergency Systems) project is a real-time fire detection system developed by undergraduate students in Electrical, Computer, Optics Engineering. Unlike traditional smoke detectors, FLAMES uses optical sensors and signal processing to detect fire based solely on light characteristics.

## Project Structure

- **Midterm_Demo/**  
  Evolved demonstration setup used during the midterm demo to showcase core system functionality, involves code for BASYS 3 Dev Board, Custom ESP32-WROOM-32D PCB, and Raspberry Pi 5.

- **Mini_Demo/**  
  Initial compact demo setup for validating core functionality in a simplified environment.

- **Ronex_Test/**  
  Code and tests involving Ronex's ESP32 board and motor interface trials.

- **Test/**  
  General testing and prototyping files.

## Technologies Used

- ESP32-WROOM-32D Microcontroller  
- Adafruit TSL2591 Light Sensor
- FDS1010 Silicon Photodiode  
- DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver  
- Basys 3 FPGA Board
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Raspberry Pi Global Shutter CMOS Sensor
- NEMA 23 Stepper Motor

## Software and Frameworks Used

- MATLAB HDL Coder  
- C++, Verilog, and Python  
- OpenCV library (for image-based analysis)

## Objective

To detect fire signals quickly and accurately using light intensity, frequency characteristics, color characteristics, and real-time control systemsâ€”without relying on traditional smoke detection methods.
